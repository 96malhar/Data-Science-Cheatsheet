# Data-Science-Cheat-Sheet

This cheatsheet is currently a 9-page reference in basic data science that covers basic concepts in proabability, statistics, statistical learning, machine learning, big data frameworks and SQL.

The cheatsheet is loosely based off of *The Data Science Design Manual* by Steven S. Skiena and *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

Inspired by William Chen's *The Only Probability Cheatsheet You'll Ever Need*, located [here](https://github.com/wzchen/probability_cheatsheet).
